Instructions

Retrieve the data
The data is located in the Resources folder.

  lending_data.csv

Import the data using Pandas.

Predict Model Performance

     You will be creating and comparing two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. Before you create, fit, and score the models,
      make a prediction as to which model you think will perform better. You do not need to be correct! Write down (in markdown cells in your Jupyter Notebook or in a        separate document) your prediction, and provide justification for your educated guess.






Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets



     Creating the features DataFrame, X, by removing the loan_status column. Create y, the labels set, by using the loan_status column. Split the data into training        and    testing datasets by using the train_test_split function.










Create, Fit and Compare Models



       Create a LogisticRegression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score. Do the same for a RandomForestClassifier. You may choose any starting              hyperparameters you like. Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction? Write down your results and thoughts.
